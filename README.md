# xkcdComics

I wanted to do most of the points in this task but i wasn't able to. I Have made an app that has a bit of influence on the Tinder design (even though i never used Tinder). The app has a header with the name of the app, a big display of the comic from the XkcdComics api, buttons for navigation and favoriting a comic on the bottom, and a favorites tab. Unfortunately i wasn't able to get favorites to work so i decided to not include this feature for the MVP. I could add this later when i have more experience. I did add a placeholder list for wehen i get this feature to work.

My Thoughts are that the navigation buttons on the bottom are very reachable and easy to understand. The comics are the main feature of the app and thats why they take up morst of the screen.

I would like to add that i think this has been a very cool and challenging task where i got to put my knowlege to the test.

Hope you like it.
